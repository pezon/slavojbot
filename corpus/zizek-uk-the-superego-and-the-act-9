Schmiracher: Lacan always rejected a patient who came with an explanation to him — he would say “You know already what you have so please leave.”

Zizek: You know what Lacan also did when the patient tried to explain. He did one of three things: One thing was that he would start doing crossword puzzles and interrupt them with questions, “OK, but tell me a word with five letters that designates an animal.” The other thing Lacan did was put out his wallet and started to count money like this. The third thing was, he had these thick, sour cakes… He would put a cake into his tea and then into his mouth and start to suck it disgustingly.
