The Japanese have perhaps found a unique way out of this deadlock of the superego: bravely confronting the paradox by directly organizing “fun” as part of their everyday duty, so that, when the official, organized fun activity is over, they are relieved of their duty and are finally free to have fun for real, to relax and enjoy. Another attempt to resolve this same deadlock is the typical hysterical strategy of changing (suspending) the symbolic link while pretending that nothing has changed in reality: a husband, for example, who divorces his wife and then continues to visit her home and children regularly, as if nothing had happened, feels not only as much at home as before, but even more relaxed. Since the symbolic obligation to the family has been undone, he can really take it easy and enjoy it—like the Japanese who can enjoy once the injunction to enjoy is over. Against this background, it is easy to discern the liberating potential of being relieved of enjoyment: in this way, one is relieved of the monstrous duty to enjoy.

On closer analysis, one would thus have to distinguish between two types of “the Other doing (or, rather, enduring) it for me”:

 – In the case of commodity fetishism, our belief is displaced onto the Other: I think I do not believe, but I believe through the Other. The gesture of criticism here consists in the assertion of identity: no, it is YOU who believes through the Other (in the theological whimsies of commodities, in Santa Claus).

 – In the case of a video-recorder viewing and enjoying a film for you (or the canned laughter, or the weepers who cry and mourn for you, or the Tibetan prayer wheel) the situation is the reverse: you think you enjoyed the show, but the Other did it for you. The gesture of criticism here is that, no it was NOT YOU who laughed, it was the Other (the TV set) who did it.

Isn’t the key to this distinction that we are dealing here with the opposition between belief and jouissance, between the Symbolic and the Real? In the case of (symbolic) belief, you disavow the identity (you do not recognize yourself in the belief that is yours); in the case of (real) jouissance, you erroneously recognize the decenterment in what you (mis)perceive as “your own” jouissance. Perhaps the fundamental attitude defining the subject is neither that of passivity nor that of autonomous activity, but precisely that of interpassivity. This interpassivity is to be opposed to the Hegelian List der Vernunft (“cunning of reason”). In the case of the latter, I am active through the other, which means that I can remain passive while the Other does it for me (like the Hegelian Idea that remains outside of the conflict, letting human passions do the work for it). In the case of interpassivity, I am passive through the Other I concede to the Other the passive aspect (of enjoying), while I can remain actively engaged (I can continue to work in the evening, while the VCR passively enjoys for me; I can make financial arrangements for the deceased’s fortune while the weepers mourn for me). This allows us to propose the notion of false activity: you think you are active, while your true position, as it is embodied in the fetish, is passive. Do we not encounter something akin to this false activity in the paradox of predestination (the very fact that things are decided in advance, i.e., that our attitude to Fate is that of a passive victim, instigates us to engage ourselves in incessant frenetic activity), as well as in the typical strategy of the obsessional neurotic, which also involves a “false activity”: he or she is frantically active in order to prevent the real thing from happening (in a group situation in which some tension threatens to explode, the obsessional talks all the time, tells jokes, etc., in order to prevent the awkward moment of silence that would make the participants aware of the underlying tension).

The object that gives body to the surplus-enjoyment fascinates the subject, reduces him or her to a passive gaze impotently gaping at the object; this relationship, of course, is experienced by the subject as something shameful, unworthy. Being directly transfixed by the object, passively submitting to its power of fascination, is ultimately unbearable: the open display of the passive attitude of “enjoying it” somehow deprives the subject of his or her dignity. Interpassivity is therefore to be conceived as the primordial form of the subject’s defense against jouissance: I defer jouissance to the Other, who passively endures it (laughs, suffers, enjoys) on my behalf. In this precise sense, the effect of the subject supposed to enjoy (i.e., the gesture of transposing one’s jouissance to the Other) is perhaps even more primordial than that of the “subject supposed to know,” or the “subject supposed to believe.” Therein resides the libidinal strategy of a pervert who assumes the position of the pure instrument of the Other’s jouissance: for the (male) pervert, the sexual act (coitus) involves a clear division of labor in which he reduces himself to a pure tool of her enjoyment; he is doing the hard work, accomplishing the active gestures, while the woman, transported in ecstasy, passively endures it and stares into the air. In the course of the psychoanalytic treatment, the subject has to learn to assume directly his relationship to the object that gives body to his jouissance, bypassing the proxy who enjoys in his place, instead of him. The disavowed fundamental passivity of my being is structured in the fundamental fantasy that, although a priori inaccessible to me, regulates the way I relate to jouissance. For that precise reason, it is impossible for the subject to assume his fundamental fantasy without undergoing the radical experience of “subjective destitution”: in assuming my fundamental fantasy, I take upon myself the passive kernel of my being (i.e., the kernel whose distance sustains my subjective activity). The substitution of the object for the subject is thus in a way even more primordial than the substitution of the signifier for the subject: if the signifier is the form of “being active through another,” the object is the form of “being passive through another”: the object is primordially that which suffers, endures it, for me, in my place—in short, that which enjoys for me. Thus, what is unbearable in my encounter with the object is that in it, I see myself in the guise of a suffering object: what reduces me to a fascinated passive observer is the scene of myself passively enduring it. Far from being an excessive phenomenon that occurs only in extreme “pathological” situations, interpassivity, in its opposition to interactivity (not in the standard sense of interacting with the medium, but in the sense of another doing it for me, in my place), is thus the feature that defines the most elementary level, the necessary minimum, of subjectivity: in order to be an active subject, I have to get rid of—and transpose onto the other—the inert passivity that contains the density of my substantial being. In this precise sense, the opposition signifier/object overlaps with the opposition interactivity/interpassivity: signifier is interactive, it is active on my behalf, in my place, while object is interpassive, it suffers for me. Transposing onto another my very passive experience is a much more uncanny phenomenon than that of being active through another: in interpassivity, I am decentered in a much more radical way than in interactivity, since interpassivity deprives me of the very kernel of my substantial identity.
